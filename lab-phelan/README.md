In /lib, i have two .js files - both enumerate CommonJS-style modules, and pin them to 'module.exports' at the very end of the file.

In 'greet.js', per the instructions, I returned a single function, sayHi(), which appends 'hello ' to the front of a string provided by the user... and, if the user send in input other than of Type 'string', it returns 'null'.

In 'greet.js', per the instructions, I returned an Object, "Arith" with two functions within it; add() adds the two provided numbers together, and sub() subtracts them. In both functions, if either of the input values provided are not of Type 'number', I return 'null'.

Easy.

Beans.
